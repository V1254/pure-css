```bash
git clone https://github.com/V1254/pure-css.git
```
- Open the index.html file in the project.

## Lessons Learnt

- CSS Grid is pretty cool, i've never used it before this project but can definately see myself using it more.
- The main area `Experience the Dream` should have just been an image.
- Lots of nifty css `rules` (if you can even call them that) that i had forgorten i managed to learn about again (hopefully won't forget em again.)

## Improvements

- If i had the time or motivation i would love to redo this project using proper semantic html but that's a lesson for another day.
- Consider using utility based css frameworks like tailwind, which would make creating this a 100% easier.
